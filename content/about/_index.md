# About Me  

I’m Kate Erickson, a technical and UX writer with over a decade of experience helping teams communicate clearly and consistently.  

I’ve built documentation systems for complex organizations, created UX copy for apps, and coached teams on writing for real people. Now I bring that expertise to small businesses and solopreneurs who want a professional, consistent voice without the overhead of a big agency.  

When your words match your brand, everything clicks. Let’s make that happen for you.
