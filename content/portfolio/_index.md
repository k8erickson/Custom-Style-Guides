# Examples  

Here’s a taste of what a style guide looks like.

## Coffee Shop (Demo)  
**Before:**  
“Our coffee is brewed in small batches to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. We use only the finest beans selected by our sourcing experts.”  

**After (Friendly Voice):**  
“We brew in small batches so your cup is always fresh. Just good beans, roasted with care.”  

✅ Clearer, friendlier, and easier to read.
